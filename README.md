# US Accidents Dataset Analysis (2016–2023)

This project leverages the **US Accidents Dataset (2016–2023)** for comprehensive data preprocessing, insightful visualizations, and analysis. The primary goal was to explore trends, identify patterns, and gain meaningful insights into accidents in the US using advanced data analysis techniques.

## Features of the Project

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled null values by replacing them with the mean of respective columns to preserve the dataset's integrity.
   - Ensured no data was lost during preprocessing as retaining the complete dataset was crucial for analysis.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Created detailed and informative visualizations to highlight trends and patterns.
   - Utilized **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for advanced visualization tasks, including heatmaps, line plots, and scatter plots.

3. **Technologies and Libraries Used:**
   - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
   - **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and visually appealing visualizations.
   - **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical data visualization and easy-to-understand plots.

## Steps in the Project

1. **Dataset Loading**:
   Imported the US Accidents dataset spanning 2016–2023 and explored its structure using Pandas.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Identified and addressed missing values by replacing them with mean values to maintain consistency.
   - Verified dataset completeness post-preprocessing.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized accident distributions over time, location, and severity levels.
   - Analyzed correlations between weather conditions, time of day, and accident severity.


## How to Run the Project
